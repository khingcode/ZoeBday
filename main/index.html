        <p>Hey there, Zoe! Wowie! Insanity! It‚Äôs your birthday! Truly truly I say to you, 
          that whoever celebrates their birthday today must be greeted. HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I am still 
          in awe that we met and I thank God for all our memories because most of them are centered to Him. 
          Church, dancing, school, gospel sharing towards one another, and many more. Although we are far away 
          not knowing each others agenda and updates most of the times, I‚Äôm still grateful na same parin interactions 
          natin and shenanigans. Lalo na in the next few years we‚Äôll be working sooo idk what it holds HAHAHAHAHAHA 
          but we know who holds our Future. Trust in the Lord always and keep fighting the good fight. 
          Advance His kingdom wherever you go and whatever you do. Remember to rest in His presence as well 
          from time to time. Hopefully we‚Äôll meet in the future telling more stories of our individual adventures. 
          Always take care and God bless! When in doubt or danger, call your Japanese friend, aight?!?!? 
          For the glory of God, fight the good fight! </p>

        <p>ZOEEE Happy Birthday!!! There's a lot of things I want to say to you on your special day.
           I want you to know how much I appreciate you even though I know words aren't enough to fully
            express them üò≠  You're one of my constants and you're one of my go-to people whom I can easily
            vibe with. You're authenticity is unrivaled, and it's one of the trait that I found most attractive
             in you, the way you present yourself, the way you express how you feel, emotionally and physically,
              the way you treat other people, They all feel 'genuine'. Your duality is that despite being authentic,
               you have "layers" to your personality that you only show to those who trust and I know you have
                "strategies" when it comes to interacting with people AHHAHHA, I love you for that and I just want 
                to thank you for fully trusting me with those things. I was right about what I said last time about
                 your "layers" and im really happy that you showed me some of them, a different part of your
                  personality that not a lot are aware of. I love u a lot, Zoe!! and I hope u know that. One thing
                   im grateful for, and I didn't share this to you yet, is that im thankful for your "honest hours" 
                   and even our late night talks, and calls, whatever interaction we had that involved us being 
                   "vulnerable". In a way, those talks we had taught me how to be more "vulnerable" with, not only
                    other people, but also with myself. Honestly, I would feel a bit uncomfortable whenever you would
                     be vulnerable with me, not because of what you're sharing and not because I don't want to listen 
                     to you, but because I know it's hard for me to do the same, which is to be vulnerable with what
                      i feel. There is a difference between being open and being vulnerable. Thank you for making me 
                      aware of these things, through our talks, it made me realize that it's okay to just let things 
                      flow and be myself from time to time, LOVEE U ZOEE , legit appreciate ko tlga yan, thank u for
                       always asking me questions despite how random they are, thank u for always looking out for me,
                        and listening to my rants and my weird, random and unnecessary thoughts. Though I know there
                         are times where you can't find the words to reply , and u would sometimes ask if what u said
                          was okay or if it was comforting, I still appreciate it alot. and im also sorry for bombarding
                           you with my random thoughts HAHAHAH Im also grateful for how mature we both are with each other, like regarding our "boundaries" or u could also call it our "guard rails", like what I shared last time, it just frustrates me how im unable to treat you the same way I do with my other besties, but yah it's my bad cause its the consequences of our actions before (specifically my actions, nadamay ka lang HAHAH mb) pero ya, thank you for being understanding, and for overall acting mature about the entire situation, just know na I really want to talk to you all the time, not only irl but also through chat. Eto, im going full on honest hours from here on out but I wanna hangout with you, and just have long talks with u, I think it'll be fun. but yah, it's the same lang as having late-night calls with each other so it cant be AHAHAH I also want to take lots of pics with u, ALAM MO like ur one of the most important people in my life and we barely have any pics together üò≠HAHAHA pero yah, I understand why we dont have pics but at the same time, it just sucks lng HAHAHA pero sge lang ,as much as im frustrated with all of these kay I know it's all for the better, and so that wlang ma stumble, la lng sguro mini rant lang un HAHAHA just know that there are a lot of things that I wanna do with u, hopefully sometime in the near future üíú it's funny lang na I have a lot to say now, compared to last year where I said na parang it feels like there's nothing more to say to you since we said a lot of things to each other, I guess our friendship says otherwise, hurray for our evolving friendship!! Continue to grow more in Christ, God is a promise-keeper, and always surrender your plans to him, so that you may know what path he wants you to take üíú wiee praise God for your life, Zoe!! fr fr. I am forever thankful that youre one of the people who helped me reunite with Christ and thank you for being there every step of my spiritual walk, I hope I am of the same influence to you!! Fighting as always, Zoe!! continue to persevere. When in times of struggle, always seek God first above all else and above anyone else. For sure, God will send you people who will guide and comfort you, and he will speak to you through them üíú Continue to fight the good fight, fighting!! labyuuu HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GODBLESS AND ENJOY YOUR DAY!! üíú‚ú®
